# Wii U Gamepad Brute Force Sync
An Android app to help you sync your Wii U gamepad to your Wii U without a TV
This is useful in the very specific scenario where your Wii U gamepad isn't synchronized with the console and your Wii U isn't able to display an image (either because you don't have a TV or your Wii U video output isn't working)

Built using Android Studio

# Instructions

- Turn on your Wii U and wait around 2~5 minutes to make sure it booted
- Open this app on your Android phone
- Press sync one time, wait 5 seconds (or more if you want to be sure) and press sync a second time
- Press the start button
- Go trying the combinations the app gives to you
- The sync menu disappears after 3 minutes, so if the timer turns red, press the sync button to leave the sync menu and press the sync button 2 times to go back to the sync menu
